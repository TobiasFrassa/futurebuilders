# Futurebuilders
This project is a side project from me which I did during my studies in my free time. 
It is a job test that will create a personality analysis in combination with a job recommendation for the user. 
The basic idea of this is that today there are so many people that do not know what to do and where to start.
But everyone has a certain personality type and preferences that will already increase the success to be good at certain jobs and to like them. 
So why not gather this information and give a job prediction that will bring value to the user? 


# Common information

- long term mission of this project is
building a web app which gives all the people who do not know what they like and what they are good at,
a very good prediction about what they are good at and what they like to do. 

- This project could solve the problem of 
reducing the complexity of making the decision which career to choose in a world with literally endless job opportunities. 

- how can this project be different from other personality or jobs tests? 
Pretty much all job tests tests have 3 main problems.
They take either too much time, give bad predictions or are not really honest tests and manipulate the user. 
This test will take under 10 minutes, give a very exact prediction and gives honest feedback to the user. 

# Code related information

1. The user starts on the index.html page
- here the user enters very few basic information according to which he will be categorized in his relevant domain 
- for example in the category for women who are still at school and already have successfully passed class 10 

2. The user lands on a customized page now and is able to answer questions about his personality traits and priorities in combination with a career
- in our example the page is customized for students in 11., 12. oder 13. grade
- The journey in this example is: index.html/js/htmls/weiblich/Schülerin/schülerin_realschulabschluss.html

3. The user gets an evaluation of his personality and a job recommendation
- Evaluation of personality is based on the big five model (openness to experience, conscientousness, extraversion, agreeableness, extraversion) and 
the first 30 questions answered
- right now the personality analysis will be a chosen text from a certain amount of written texts the user gets to read 
- The job recommendation is based on the data the user entered (like educational level and the current job and
job related preferences that are part of the questions 31 to 60 
- right now the job recommendation is based on a certain amount of listed jobs 

# What can be improved? 

Short term improvement 
1. Obviously creating a design :D 
2. Catching the error if the user does not check all the boxes
3. Reducing the amount of different documents by choosing students under 20 as the main target group and removing all other documents

Long term improvement
1. Building a database with all jobs on the world listed in it
2. Give every job possible a different rating in all the personality and job related aspects calculated so that every job in the database can be recommended
3. Build a natural language generation model that creates the text for the personality analysis autonomously 

Very fancy ideas 
1. Giving a job recommendation based on giving access to social media Data
2. Giving a recommendation for a job based on facial recognition
3. Giving a job recommendation based on speech recognition
